'''
Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. 
We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, 
B and C, the following properties are true:

S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
If S(A) is minimised for a given n, we shall call it an optimum special sum set. 
The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.

n = 1: {1}
n = 2: {1, 2}
n = 3: {2, 3, 4}
n = 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}
n = 5: {6, 9, 11, 12, 13}

It seems that for a given optimum set, A = {a1, a2, ... , an}, the next optimum set 
is of the form B = {b, a1+b, a2+b, ... ,an+b}, where b is the "middle" element on the previous row.

By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for n = 6 to be A = {11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24},
 with S(A) = 117. However, this is not the optimum set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to 
 provide a near optimum set. The optimum set for n = 6 is A = {11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25}, with S(A) = 115 
 and corresponding set string: 111819202225.

Given that A is an optimum special sum set for n = 7, find its set string.

NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 105 and Problem 106.

def power_set(members):
    '''(tuple OR set OR list) -> list of sets

    Takes members, which is a tuple, set, or list representing the elements of
    the set for which a power set is desired. Populates a list with all the
    subsets of the group of members including the null set. Returns this list
    of sets.

    Note: in Python creating sets of sets is complicated and requires ordered
        sets, so this implementation actually returns a list of sets, not a
        set of sets.

    Takes members, which is a tuple, set, or list representing the elements of

    Returns True if the number of non-empty subsets of members is equal to the
    number of elements in a set containing the sum of each subset. Returns
    False if the lengths differ, as this implies that at least two subsets
    have the same sum.

def larger_subsets_have_larger_sums(members):
    '''(tuple OR set OR list) -> bool

    Takes members, which is a tuple, set, or list representing the elements of
    the set for which a power set is desired. The parameter members will
    henceforth be referred to as a set for convenience. Checks that for any
    non-empty, disjoint subsets B and C, if B has more elements than C, then
    sum(B) > sum(C). Returns True if this condition holds. Returns False
    otherwise.

    This condition is checked by comparing extreme cases: we consider every
    possible pair of disjoint subset sizes n and n - 1 for 1 < n. For each
    pair of sizes we compare the smallest possible sum of a subset of size n
    to the largest sum of a subset of size n - 1. (We increment n until any
    further increase in n would imply that the two subsets would not be
    disjoint. This occurs when n is equal to the integer portion of the length
    of members divided by two.) If the sums of the subsets of size n are
    larger than the sums of the subsets of size n - 1 in every case we know
    that the condition holds and we return True. If any sum of the subset of
    size n - 1 is larger than the associated sum of the subset of size n then
    we have proven that there is at least pair of sizes for which the
    condition does not hold and we return False.

    For example, if members contains 7 elements we compare the sums of these
    pairs of subsets:
        i. The smallest-sum subset of size 2 vs. the largest-sum
            subset of size 1;
        ii. The smallest-sum subset of size 3 vs. the largest-sum
            subset of size 2;
        iii. The smallest-sum subset of size 4 vs. the largest-sum
            subset of size 3.
