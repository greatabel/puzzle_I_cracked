'''
Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. 
We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets,
 B and C, the following properties are true:

S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly increasing elements 
and it already satisfies the second rule.

Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which n = 4, 
only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule). Similarly, when n = 7, only 70 
out of the 966 subset pairs need to be tested.

For n = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality?

NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 103 and Problem 105.
