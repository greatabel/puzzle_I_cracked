'''
Let pn be the nth prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., 
and let r be the remainder when (pn−1)^n + (pn+1)^n is divided by pn^2.

For example, when n = 3, p3 = 5, and 4^3 + 6^3 = 280 ≡ 5 mod 25.

The least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 10^9 is 7037.

Find the least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 10^10.
