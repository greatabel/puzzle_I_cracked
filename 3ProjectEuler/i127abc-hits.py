'''
The radical of n, rad(n), is the product of distinct prime factors of n. 

For example, 504 = 23 × 32 × 7, so rad(504) = 2 × 3 × 7 = 42.

We shall define the triplet of positive integers (a, b, c) to be an abc-hit if:

GCD(a, b) = GCD(a, c) = GCD(b, c) = 1
a < b
a + b = c
rad(abc) < c
For example, (5, 27, 32) is an abc-hit, because:

GCD(5, 27) = GCD(5, 32) = GCD(27, 32) = 1
5 < 27
5 + 27 = 32
rad(4320) = 30 < 32
It turns out that abc-hits are quite rare and there are only thirty-one abc-hits for c < 1000, with ∑c = 12523.

Find ∑c for c < 120000.
