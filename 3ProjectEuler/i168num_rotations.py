Number Rotations

Problem 168
Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the last digit (7) to the front of it, 

giving us 714285.
It can be verified that 714285=5Ã—142857.
This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its right-rotation.

Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10 < n < 10100, that have this property.
